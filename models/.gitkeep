# This file ensures the models directory is tracked by Git
# 
# This directory will contain:
# - Trained model artifacts (.joblib, .h5, .pt files)
# - Model metadata and configurations
# - Lightweight model checkpoints for reproducibility
#
# Note: Large model files should be excluded via .gitignore
# but this directory structure should be preserved
