# This directory will contain:
# - MLflow experiment tracking data
# - Run metadata and parameters
# - Metrics and artifacts from training runs
#
# Note: The actual mlruns/ contents may be excluded via .gitignore
# depending on your MLflow tracking preferences, but this directory
# structure should be preserved for the project
